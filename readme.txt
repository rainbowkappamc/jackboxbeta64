Trivia Beta64 Party Mod Development Build for V5.
---
This version is a in-development build for TB64P and Scott Boat
which implements a filesystem mod for Pack 6 that allows you to not be forced to replace
the base files included in your copy of Jackbox Party Pack 6. If you want to revert to vanilla Jackbox 6 , all you need to replace is TJPPLoader.swf now instead of the entire install which should hugely quicken any file updates in the future if we need to push anything for bugs and/or features!

INSTRUCTIONS TO INSTALL / UNINSTALL :
TO INSTALL : Copy and replace the existing files in the steam game directory.
TO UNINSTALL : Go to steam and reverify the files to revert the game to it's nonmodded version.
