# The Beta64 Mod for The JBPP6
A Jackbox 6 Mod that adds trivia around Beta64's Community.
DEVELOPMENT FOR V5 WHICH IS PLANNED TO BE THE LAST BIG UPDATE.

Notes about Dev Branch :
Will update more often than prereleases for dev though will contain MASSIVE SPOILERS / you will be spoiled before Beta64 and targetted audiences play.
Bugs exist in these, size varies a lot!

filesize varies. V5 averages 1-2 gigs fully atm.

Root folder is release and web-end stuff
pack_development contains game-specific wip stuff
